I create one web based application in java programming language and Eclipse IDE framework that will play music automatically according to user starting time and and also stop music automatically according to user ending time. we also added features like pause, resume and restart if user manually press the specified key. With the help of this application who have habit to sleep with listening music at night but fall asleep while listening itself . so the music will be keep on and drain phone battery which also includes data uses if the music is played from live streaming. So in this case creating such application will resolve the problem.
