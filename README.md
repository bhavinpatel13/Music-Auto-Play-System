This system is java based web application in which music will play automatically as per the user input time as “start time” and it will stop according to the user input “end time”. User have been given additional features like resume, pause and restart the song whenever user wants just by pressing the specified key. This type of application will be very helpful for the people who have a habit of listening songs before sleeping and meanwhile they sleeps and this reduce battery life and consumes mobile data, so in this case creating such application will resolve the problem.
